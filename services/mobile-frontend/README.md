const mobileFrontend = require('@logan/mobile-frontend');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```

## Running the mobile frontend
To run the frontend, first install expo-cli using
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Once the expo-cli is installed, navigate to the mobile frontend directory and run:
```
expo start
```

You should be navigated to an external link, where you can simulate Android, iOS, or web.
To simulate the frontend on your own device, select **tunnel** as the connection and scan the
QR code using the expo app. This should then start running the app on your device.
