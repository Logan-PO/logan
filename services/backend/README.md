## Running the Backend Locally

To run the backend locally, navigate to the repo root and run `sam local start-api` to host a local backend at
 127.0.0.1:3000.

You'll need the AWS SAM CLI installed to run it. You can run `sam --version` to check if you do or not. If not, follow
 [this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) to install it.
