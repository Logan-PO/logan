# Frontend quick guide

 Gatsby is a sort of _*"middleware"*_ in the sense that it runs itself in response to nodejs starting and compiles all 
 of the js before it is ready to be viewed
 
## Gatsby Commands
 The main commands used will be `gatsby start` for compiling the frontend (this will also be called by gatsby in response to `npm start` or `npm run`, `gatsby test`,and possibly `gatsby clean`

The rest of the commands are commands included in the default gatsby package calls when compiling
## Frontend Commands
 if you want to compile and test the frontend simply call the `npm start` command in **services/frontend** and after
 ~10 seconds you will be provided with the link required the website can be found at in the chat. After the first build 
 and compile it is **not** necessary to call `npm start` after every change and all you need to do is refresh the page.
